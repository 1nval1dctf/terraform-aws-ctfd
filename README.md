# CTFd AWS Terraform module

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/invalidctf/invalidctf/_apis/build/status/1nval1dctf.terraform-aws-ctfd?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/invalidctf/invalidctf/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

Terraform module to deploy [CTFd](https://ctfd.io/) into scalable AWS infrastructure

*WARNING* This module has never been battle tested. It was developed for use in a CTF for a security conference that was cancelled due to COVID-19. The author is neither a CTFd developer nor a cloud expert and did this module partially as a learning exercise. That's not to say you shouldn't use it but if you do plan on using it, and have expertise, it would be great to have feedback/contributions on both the deployment model and terraform coding. Further you almost certainly want to scale out the instance from what is done below - these were chosen to keep costs low during development.


## Usage

```hcl
module "ctfd" {
  source  = "1nval1dctf/ctfd/aws"
  force_destroy_challenge_bucket = true
  db_cluster_instance_type = "db.t2.small"
  db_deletion_protection = false
  elasticache_cluster_instance_type = "cache.t2.micro"
  elasticache_cluster_instances = 2
  asg_instance_type = "t2.micro"
  workers = 3
  worker_connections = 3000
  ctfd_version = "2.3.3"
  # If you need custom themes or plugins create a gzip tarball that can be applied to the root ctfd source checkout directory. i.e. should contain `CTFd/[plugins/themes]/your_extra_stuff`
  ctfd_overlay = "path/to/ctd_overlay.tar.gz"
}
```

## Design


The CTFd setup Looks something like this:

```mermaid
graph TB

  subgraph "Uploads"
    S3[S3]
  end

  subgraph "RDS (mysql)"
    RDS[RDS autoscale]
  end

  subgraph "ElasticCache (redis)"
    REDIS[REDIS] --> ElasticCache1[Instance 1]
    REDIS[REDIS] --> ElasticCache[...]
    REDIS[REDIS] --> ElasticCacheN[Instance n]
  end

  subgraph "Load Balancer"
    LB[LB] --> Instance1[Instance 1]
    LB[LB] --> Instance[...]
    LB[LB] --> InstanceN[Instance n]
    Instance1 --> RDS[RDS]
    Instance --> RDS[RDS]
    InstanceN --> RDS[RDS]
    Instance1 --> REDIS[REDIS]
    Instance --> REDIS[REDIS]
    InstanceN --> REDIS[REDIS]
    Instance1 --> S3[S3]
    Instance --> S3[S3]
    InstanceN --> S3[S3]
    end
```

*Note* CTFd does not currently support separate database readers/writers or proper sharding for ElastiCache so the cluster setups are likely overkill for what we get.

## Debugging

AWS Systems Manager Session Manager is configured on all instances created for this setup. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html) for more information.

If you install aws cli and the session manager plugin https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html

Then you can do the following:
```bash
aws ssm start-session --target [target_id]
```

You may want to find the frontend instances with the following(assuming default app-name)
```bash
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag-value,Values=ctfd-autoscaling-group" --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId"
```

### confirming db connectivity

```bash
(cd /opt/ctfd && sudo -u www-data ../ctfd-scripts/db_check.sh)
```

### confirming gunicorn / CTFd

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
### confirming gunicorn service

```bash
sudo -u www-data curl --unix-socket /run/gunicorn.sock http
```

### Manually running CTFd

```bash
sudo systemctl stop gunicorn.service
(cd /opt/ctfd && sudo -u www-data ../ctfd-scripts/gunicorn.sh )
```

### Checking for issues with cloadwatch logging

Confirm the agent is running
```bash
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -m ec2 -a status
```

View agent logs

```bash
cat /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/configuration-validation.log
```
